# Assignment 1 Postmortem

## What's your past experience with front-end development?
I'm most interested in UI and front-end development, so I've learned a little beyond the basics of design and web development. Also, the past two summers I've interned with AT&T in their Emerging Technologies program. Both times I worked as a front-end developer in my intern scrum teams.


## How difficult was this assignment?
Not difficult at all. The most trouble I had was getting rid of encoded characters that were messing up with the code.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
The assigment was mostly a refresher for me, though I thought it was great that we had to got to use all three parts of a responsive website (HTML, CSS, and JS) on our first homework.


## How could this assignment be improved?
You could challenge us to find another script we could use on a different button. Just to see what we could come up with.


## Any other comments?
Not really. Looking forward to class!
